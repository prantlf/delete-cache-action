# Changes

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/prantlf/delete-cache-action/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.0) (2023-10-19)

### Chores

* Bump Node.js version from 16 to 20 ([1327b1f](https://github.com/prantlf/delete-cache-action/commit/1327b1fb7b1e6ac19d685fd30507849b0737ded0))

### BREAKING CHANGES

Although I do not know what could break, because this action
runs with its own Node.js version, such change in the build environment might
break something unexpectedly. For example, Node.js prefers IPV6 to IPV4 since
17. However, there are no known problems or migration steps necessary.
